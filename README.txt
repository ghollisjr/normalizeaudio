normalizeaudio.sh is a Bash script to normalize audio using EBU R128
parameters supplied to FFmpeg.  It works with both audio-only and
audio-video files.

It was something I found necessary often enough that I got tired of
searching the internet for the magic words to tell FFmpeg to make it
happen.

normalizeaudio is in the public domain.
